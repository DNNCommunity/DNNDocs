# Delete a Logged Event Type

If multiple entries for the same event type exist, delete the global one (**Website** is set to **All**) before deleting the specific ones (**Website** is set to a specific site).

> [!TIP]
> If you might want to log the event again in the future, you can turn off **Logging** to stop logging the event type, instead of deleting it.

## Prerequisites

*   **A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance.

## Steps

1.  Go to **Persona Bar \> Manage \> Admin Logs**.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Admin Logs](/images/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
2.  Go to the **Log Settings** tab.
    
    ![Log Settings](/images/scr-pbtabs-host-Manage-AdminLogs-LogSettings-E90.png)
    
3.  Click/Tap the pencil icon for the logged event type to delete.

4.  Click/Tap **Delete**.

5.  Confirm.
