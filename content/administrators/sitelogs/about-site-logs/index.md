# About Site Logs

Each site maintains its own log of events that the host chooses. Notices can be sent by email if the logged event exceeds a threshold, such as a specified number of occurences within a specified length of time.

> [!Tip]
> Monitor your logs to be familiar with your site's traffic patterns. It would help you identify unusual patterns that might indicate attempted security attacks.
