# Configure the Activity Stream Module

## About photo entries and photo attachments

This module distinguishes between:

*   entries that are of type **Photos**, and
*   entries that have photo/image attachments.

If the type **Photos** is checked, photo entries are displayed. If unchecked, photo entries are hidden.

If either **Enable File Attachments** or **Enable Photo Attachments** is checked, entries with photo/image attachments are displayed. If both are unchecked, entries with photo/image attachments are hidden.

> [!NOTE] 
> If **Enable Photo Attachments** is checked, be sure to also check the type **Photos**. Otherwise, a user could create an entry with an attached photo, but they would not know that it was actually created, because they cannot see it.

A photo entry cannot have a file attachment. However, an entry with a photo attachment can have additional attachments.

## Steps

1.  Go to the page containing the module to configure. Edit the page.
2.  In the module's action menu bar, go to **Manage (gear icon) \> Settings**.
