# Manage a User Password

You can reset the user password in three ways:

*   You can change the password for the user. If the site is configured with password rules (i.e., minimum length), the initial password you assign must obey those password rules.
*   You can send the user a password reset link. The link is valid for 24 hours.
*   You can force the user to change their password at the next login. This action cannot be undone.

## Prerequisites

*   **An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.

2.  Search for the user account.
    
    *   Use the Search Users textbox at the top to search by a user account field, such as First Name, Last Name, User Name, or Email Address.
    *   Filter the displayed accounts by type, using the Show dropdown.
