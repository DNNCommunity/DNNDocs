# Delete a User Account

## Prerequisites

*   **An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Users](/images/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
    ➊
    
    ➋
    
2.  Search for the user account.
    
    *   Use the Search Users textbox at the top to search by a user account field, such as First Name, Last Name, User Name, or Email Address.
    *   Filter the displayed accounts by type, using the Show dropdown.

3.  Click/Tap the ellipses icon for the user, then choose Delete User.

    Note: Deletion simply makes the account unavailable and revokes user-specific permissions. You must also remove the user from assigned roles to revoke role-based permissions.
    

## What to do next

(Optional) You can purge the user account(s) if you want to permanently delete the user account and its associated information.
