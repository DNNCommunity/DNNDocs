# Delete All Unauthorized Users

## Prerequisites

*   **An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Users](/images/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
    ➊
    
    ➋
    
2.  Search for the unauthorized user.
    
    1.  From the Show dropdown, choose Unauthorized to filter the displayed accounts.
    2.  Browse the list for the user account.

3.  For each user to delete, click/tap the ellipses icon, then choose Delete User.
    
      
    
    ![User List > find the user > ellipses icon > Delete User](/images/scr-UserList-ellipsesmenu-DeleteUser-E90.png)
    
      
    
    Note: Deletion simply makes the account unavailable and revokes user-specific permissions. You must also remove the user from assigned roles to revoke role-based permissions.
    

## What to do next

(Optional) You can purge the user account(s) if you want to permanently delete the user account and its associated information.
