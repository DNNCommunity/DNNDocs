# Manage a Host's Password

You can reset the user password in three ways:

*   You can change the password for the user. If the site is configured with password rules (i.e., minimum length), the initial password you assign must obey those password rules.
*   You can send the user a password reset link. The link is valid for 24 hours.
*   You can force the user to change their password at the next login. This action cannot be undone.

## Prerequisites

*   **A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
