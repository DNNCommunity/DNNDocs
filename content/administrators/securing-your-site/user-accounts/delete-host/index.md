# Delete a Host Account

## Prerequisites

*   **A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Users](/images/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
    ➊
    
    ➋
    
2.  Search for the super user account.
    
    1.  From the Show dropdown, choose Superusers to filter the displayed accounts.
    2.  Browse the list for the user account.

3.  Click/Tap the ellipses icon for the user, then choose Delete User.
    
      
    
    ![User List > Show: Superusers > find the user > ellipses icon > Delete User](/images/scr-UserList-hostellipsesmenu-DeleteUser-E90.png)
    
      
    
    Note: Deletion simply makes the account unavailable and revokes user-specific permissions. You must also remove the user from assigned roles to revoke role-based permissions.
    

## What to do next

(Optional) You can purge the user account(s) if you want to permanently delete the user account and its associated information.
