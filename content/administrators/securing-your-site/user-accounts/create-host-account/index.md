# Create a Host Account

Hosts (also known as super users) have full permissions to all sites within the DNN instance. Only a host can promote/demote a user account to/from a host account.

Warning:

Hosts can revoke permissions from or demote another host.

## Prerequisites

*   **A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Users](/images/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
2.  Click/Tap Add User.

3.  Enter the user's information.
    
      
    
    ![Add New User](/images/scr-AddNewUserInfo-E90.png)
    
      
    
    |Field|Description|
    |---|---|
    |<strong>Authorized</strong>|If enabled (<strong>On</strong>), the user is immediately subscribed to the <strong>Registered User</strong> role and to other roles that have <strong>Auto Assignment</strong> enabled. If disabled (<strong>Off</strong>), the user account is created but not authorized; an administrator must authorize the user account before the user can access areas of the website that are restricted to <strong>Registered User</strong> members.|    
    |<strong>Random Password</strong>|If enabled (<strong>On</strong>), generates a random password. Otherwise, you must provide a password.|
    |<strong>Password</strong>|If the site is configured with password rules (i.e., minimum length), the initial password you assign must obey those password rules.|
    |<strong>Send an Email to New User</strong>|If checked, the user is notified by email that the account is created. Can be checked at a later time to send the email belatedly.|
    
4.  Search for the user account.
    
    *   Use the Search Users textbox at the top to search by a user account field, such as First Name, Last Name, User Name, or Email Address.
    *   Filter the displayed accounts by type, using the Show dropdown.
