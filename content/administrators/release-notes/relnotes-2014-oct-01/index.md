EVOQ ENGAGE (EVOQ SOCIAL 2.0.0)

    *   Created a new control panel that replaces Social Dashboard and Gaming Mechanics Administration.
    *   Added additional analytic tracking and reporting options.
    *   Added community health indicators.
    *   Added ability to manage users.
    *   Surfaced tasks in this area.
    *   Centralized community setting management.
*   Enabled Friendly URLs for the main 6 content oriented modules (great for SEO, also avoids duplicate page titles; cid/## will become /my-content-title).
*   Surfaced comment moderation in additional areas (Discussions, Events and Ideas).
*   Added ability to report a user which results in notifications to moderators and community managers.
    *   Users can be removed from the profile area as well.
*   Added Upcoming events view in Social Events and made it the default view, shows only events currently in progress or scheduled in the future.
*   Added ability to delete a user from the user's profile page (this is a soft-delete) as well as promote them to a moderator role.
*   Updated search control in the seven social modules that use it to be a companion module, and thus optional to show/hide for site administrators and page editors.
    *   This also exposes a new create button in the left hand footer of those modules too, to enable creation when search is not displayed (or without requiring a scroll to top for end users).
