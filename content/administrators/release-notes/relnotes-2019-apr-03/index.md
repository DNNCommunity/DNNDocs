Below you can find a short list of the noteworthy changes in this release. For a full list, please check the GitHub milestone pages on each of the repositories.

## Known Potential Breaking Changes

If you currently use any 3rd party or in-house Persona Bar extensions which utilize the export bundle from the Admin Experience, they will need to be updated after upgrading to v9.3.1. Please see the Additional Resources section below for more information on this change.

## Changes Since 9.3.0
Fixed version issue with AdminExperience, CKEditor, FolderProviders, and JWT. These extensions were incorrectly versioned in the 9.3.0 release. This caused the upgrade process for v9.2.2 sites to skip upgrading those extensions. This resulted in an upgrade that appeared successful but was incomplete.

## Noteworthy Changes in 9.3.1

* NuGet Package Improvements. Thanks @mitchelsellers [#2600](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/pull/2600)
