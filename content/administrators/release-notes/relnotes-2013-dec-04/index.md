# DNN Release Notes — 2013 Dec 04

## DNN PLATFORM 7.2.0

[CodePlex](https://dotnetnuke.codeplex.com/releases/view/115680)

Application features

*   Responsive Design Skin: The Gravity skin was redesigned to use the Bootstrap framework which provides for a fully responsive design out of the box.
*   The SQL module has undergone a complete overhaul in 7.2.0 including a new editor and updated query results pane.
*   The DNN Module Creator has been incorporated directly into DNN making it easier than ever to get started writing your new DNN extension.
*   The DNN Search has been extended in 7.2.0 to include the ability to search users and user profiles (this feature is easily disabled for those who would prefer not to use it).

Developer features

*   JavaScript Library Management: DNN 7.2.0 allows you to install JavaScript libraries as first party extensions. Once installed your module or skin can request that JavaScript library and the platform will automatically add the library into the page. The API mirrors the one used for jQuery and JQuery UI making it very easy to use.
