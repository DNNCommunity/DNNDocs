# DNN Release Notes — 2018 Mar 22

Released 2018 Mar 22.

## DNN PLATFORM 9.2.0

[GitHub](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/releases/tag/v9.2.0)

### DNN PROMPT
DNN Platform comes with a brand new command line interface to perform administrative tasks. Read more about [DNN Prompt here](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155456/previewing-prompt-in-dnnevoq-920). DNN Prompt is extensible as well, meaning you can add your own commands as well. Look out for a future blog on this topic.

### UPDATED PAGE MANAGEMENT
The page management experience has been greatly enhanced using tree view navigation. You can drag & drop !)

### INTRODUCING CONNECTORS (ALONG WITH AZURE STORAGE CONNECTOR)
Connectors were first introduced in Evoq to have a single place to manage external connections. Evoq integrates with several services such as Dropbox, Box, Mailchimp, Zendesk, etc., which all use one common interface to define and configure connection information. Just like anything else in DNN, Connectors were built with extensibility in mind. We have now moved the base Connectors framework into DNN Platform. Along with that, we also made the Azure Storage Connector availble in Platform as well. Look out for a future blog on this topic.

### PERFORMANCE UPDATES
