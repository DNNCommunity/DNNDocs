# Error: Could not load file or assembly 'AWSSDK' or one of its dependencies

## Symptom

Error after upgrading a site:

Could not load file or assembly 'AWSSDK' or one of its dependencies.

## Possible Cause

A custom module uses a different version of AWSSDK.DLL.

## Solution

1.  Back up the site and the database.
2.  Open the /bin/Providers subfolder of the site folder.
3.  Right-click the AWSSDK.DLL file and select Properties.
4.  Within the pop-up dialog, switch to the Details tab and verify that the file version is 1.2.3.1.
5.  Remove other copies of AWSSK.DLL in the /bin subfolder of the site folder.
