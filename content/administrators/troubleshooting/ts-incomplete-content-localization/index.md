# Troubleshooting: Incomplete Content Localization

## Symptom

After enabling localization, only some content is localized.

## Possible Cause

The localization process timed out during the conversion.

## Solution

1.  Back up the site and the database.
2.  Go to Persona Bar \> Settings \> SQL Console.
3.  Delete the culture code of the aborted localization process.

    Run the following SQL script:

    ```

    DELETE
    FROM Tabs
    WHERE CultureCode = 'xx-XX';

    ```

    where xx-XX is the culture code of the added language.

4.  Disable content localization for the site.

    Run the following SQL script:

    ```

    UPDATE Tabs
    SET CultureCode = NULL;

    UPDATE PortalSettings
    SET SettingValue = 'False'
    WHERE SettingName = 'ContentLocalizationEnabled'
    	AND PortalID = xx;

    ```

    where xx is the ID of the site for which localization was enabled.

5.  [Recycle the application pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc770764(v%3dws.10)) to allow the changes to take effect.

6.  Rerun the localization process.
