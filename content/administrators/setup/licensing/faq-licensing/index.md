# FAQ: Licensing

I activated my license but my Evoq website still says that I am on the trial version.

See [Troubleshoot: Trial message still appears after license activation](xref:troubleshooting-licensing).

Can I activate a license on a server without internet access?

See [Activate License Manually](xref:activate-license-manually).

How do I view my available licenses?

Go to Host \> Advanced Settings (double-gear tab) \> License Management, and then search for your email address or invoice number.

How do I recover a production license that was inadvertently activated in a local development environment?

Please contact [Customer Support](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/services/customer-support).

How do I delete an activated development license in my local server?

While logged in as Host, go to Host \> Advanced Settings (double-gear tab) \> License Management, then delete the license from the list.
