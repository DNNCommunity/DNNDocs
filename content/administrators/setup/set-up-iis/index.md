You can create a new website or set up an existing one for use with DNN. Choose one of the next two steps.

2.  To create a new website and point it to the DNN installation folder:
    1.  Go to Control Panel \> Administrative Tools \> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
    2.  In the Connections panel, expand your host tree, right-click on Sites, and choose Add Website.

    3.  Enter the new website's name and choose the location.



        ![Enter the new website's name and choose the location.](/images/scr-NewSiteInIIS-2.png)



    4.  Enter the Host name.

        Developers and Designers: If setting up a local development environment, you can use `www.dnndev.me` (or any subdomain). DNNDEV.ME is a registered domain which points to the loopback address of 127.0.0.1, so it will always resolve locally.

        Administrators: If setting up a live website, use your website's domain.



        ![For local, use www.dnndev.me.](/images/scr-NewSiteInIIS-4.png)



3.  To use an existing IIS website:
    1.  In the Connections panel, right-click on the name of the existing website, and choose Edit Bindings....



        ![Right-click on the website's name and choose Edit Bindings.](/images/scr-NewSiteInIIS-6.png)



    2.  In Site Bindings, click/tap Add.... In Add Site Binding, enter the Host name.

        Developers and Designers: If setting up a local development environment, you can use `www.dnndev.me` (or any subdomain). DNNDEV.ME is a registered domain which points to the loopback address of 127.0.0.1, so it will always resolve locally.

        Administrators: If setting up a live website, use your website's domain.



        ![For local, use www.dnndev.me.](/images/scr-NewSiteInIIS-7.png)



4.  If you do not use **NETWORK SERVICE** as the user account to run your website, verify that **IIS AppPool\\AppPoolName** has **Full** or **Modify** permissions for the DNN installation folder.

    The account **IIS AppPool\\AppPoolName** is automatically created by IIS.

    See [Set Up DNN Folder and the User Account](xref:set-up-dnn-folder).
