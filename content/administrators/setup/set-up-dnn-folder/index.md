# Set Up the DNN Folder and the User Account

## Steps

1.  [Download DNN and extract the files.](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/community/download/)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you get a Windows Security Warning while attempting to unzip the file, you might need to [unblock the DNN zip file](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/) then try again. 
    
    
    > [!WARNING]
    > For your protection, remember to download or unzip files from reliable sources only.

    The folder where you extract the files becomes the DNN installation folder.

    **Developers and Designers:** For module or theme development, you don't need the source files.

    | Windows 7  Windows Server 2008 R2  |   IIS 7.5  | the **NETWORK SERVICE** account \- or - the **IIS AppPool\\AppPoolName**, which is the name of the automatically generated app.  |
    | Windows 8  Windows Server 2012  |   IIS 8 |
    |  Windows 10  |  IIS 10  |
