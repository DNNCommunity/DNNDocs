# About Connectors

Connectors enable DNN to integrate sites to third-party service providers, including Google Analytics, Marketo, and Zendesk.

In some cases, you might need to get code from the third-party service provider and insert it into DNN. In other cases, you simply need to provide your account information for that provider and DNN takes care of the rest.
