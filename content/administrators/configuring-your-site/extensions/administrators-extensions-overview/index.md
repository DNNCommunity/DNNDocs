# About Extensions

A DNN extension can contain a module, a theme, or other components that extend the functionality of the DNN Platform.

Thousands of third-party modules and themes are available from the [DNN Store](https://store.dnnsoftware.com). There are extensions for sale, including versions that include the source code, as well as some free extension.

You can also create your custom [modules](xref:create-module) and [themes](xref:create-theme).

To use an extension:

*   [Add the extension package to the DNN installation.](xref:install-extension) Requires host permissions.
*   [Set the installed extension as Premium and enable it for the websites that are authorized to use it.](xref:manage-premium-module) Requires host permissions.
*   Apply the extension to the site. Requires administrator or host permissions. If the extension is a module, you can also [set Deploy Module permissions to a role](xref:allow-module-use), in order for members of that role to be able to add a module to a page.
