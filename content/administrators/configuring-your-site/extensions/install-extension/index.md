# Install an Extension

## Prerequisites

**A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance. A host account is required to upload modules and themes, because they might contain executable code. (An administrator account is sufficient to apply modules and themes to a website.)

## Steps

1.  Go to **Persona Bar \> Settings \> Extensions**.
