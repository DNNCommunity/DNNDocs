# About Vocabularies

Vocabularies are sets of related terms that are used to categorize modules or content throughout a specific website or throughout all sites in a DNN installation.

A vocabulary's type can be:

*   Simple for folksonomy, where anyone can add a term to a flat list.
*   Hierarchy for taxonomy, where terms are typically added by the host/superuser to a hierarchy.

DNN provides two system vocabulary sets that can be edited but not deleted:

*   Tags. Terms that can be defined by anyone to categorize content. Tags can also be added to the vocabulary while editing a page.
*   Module_Categories. Terms defined by the host/superuser to categorize modules.
