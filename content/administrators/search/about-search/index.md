# About Search

DNN uses [Apache Lucene.Net](http://lucenenet.apache.org/) as the default search engine for each site. You can specify what it indexes through various settings.

*   To select webpages, set URL Paths.
*   To select asset file folders, set Included Directories and Excluded Directories.
*   To select asset file extensions, set Included File Extensions and Excluded File Extensions.

All indexes are stored in the Index Store.
