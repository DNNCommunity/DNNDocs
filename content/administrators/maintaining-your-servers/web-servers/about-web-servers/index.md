# About Web Servers

The web server list is automatically generated by the Server Web Request Adapter, based on requests that is received by the system. However, you can also choose to enable or disable any specific server. The server could still be running even though it is disabled, but its cache is no longer synchronized with the rest of the enabled servers.

In Evoq, you can manage the servers from Persona Bar \> Settings \> Servers \> Server Settings \> Web Servers.

In the DNN Platform, you can manage the web servers by using SQL commands (e.g., `select * from webservers`) through the SQL Console.

Tip: To keep the adapter working efficiently, clean up the list by removing servers that you no longer need.
