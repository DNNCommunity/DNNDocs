# Create a User Account

## Prerequisites

*   **An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Manage > Users](img/scr-pbar-host-Manage-E91.png)
    
    ➊
    
    ➋
    
2.  Click/Tap Add User.
    
      
    
    ![Add User button](img/scr-UserList-AddUser-E90.png)
    
      
    
3.  Enter the user's information.
    
      
    
    ![Add New User](img/scr-AddNewUserInfo-E90.png)
    
      
    
    Field
    
    Description
    
    Authorized
    
    If enabled (On), the user is immediately subscribed to the Registered User role and to other roles that have Auto Assignment enabled. If disabled (Off), the user account is created but not authorized; an administrator must authorize the user account before the user can access areas of the website that are restricted to Registered User members.
    
    Random Password
    
    If enabled (On), generates a random password. Otherwise, you must provide a password.
    
    Password
    
    If the site is configured with password rules (i.e., minimum length), the initial password you assign must obey those password rules.
    
    Send an Email to New User
    
    If checked, the user is notified by email that the account is created. Can be checked at a later time to send the email belatedly.
