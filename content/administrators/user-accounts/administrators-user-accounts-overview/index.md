# About User Accounts

In terms of permissions, DNN classifies user accounts into three groups:

*   Super user (host). Has full permissions for all sites within the DNN instance.
*   Administrator. Has permissions to manage one or more specific sites.
*   Regular user. Has permissions based on predefined or custom roles within a specific site.

A super user can manage all accounts, including other super user accounts. An administrator can manage the accounts of regular users and other administrators.
