# Premade, free, open source themes

For some the best way to learn anything is to copy. See a finished product, analyze and reproduce. There are several free, open source themes available for this purpose. Ã“r if the theme matches your wished: good for you :-)

## Bootstrap 4

The latest version of Bootstrap and fully loaded with all kinds of goodies. You need to have some tools working (like css preprocessors) but once that's all settled, this is a very nice way to go. Some links to free themes.

## Bootstrap 3

A little older but still used frequently. Certainly if you want to keep things simple (just css/html) this might be th eway to go.

## Theme editor

DNNConsulting has a theme editor (http://www.dnnthemeeditor.com/) that is free and open source. This allows you to change headings, font size etc. Hardcore devs may find it bloating the code but for others this might be a very nice way to offer non technical folks control over several items in the skin.
