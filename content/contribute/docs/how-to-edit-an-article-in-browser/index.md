# Edit an Article in the Browser
The easiest way to edit a DNN Doc file is to edit it in the browser on GitHub.com.

# The Steps

1. Find any file in the DNN Docs that you want to edit. The file will typically reside in a sub-folder of the "Content" folder (it may be a few levels down) and it will most likely be an ```index.md``` file.

2. Click the ```Edit``` button icon.
