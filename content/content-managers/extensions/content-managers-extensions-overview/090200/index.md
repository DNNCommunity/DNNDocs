# About Extensions

A DNN extension can contain a module, a theme, or other components that extend the functionality of the DNN Platform.

Thousands of third-party modules and themes are available from these sources:

*   [DNN Store](http://store.dnnsoftware.com): Extensions for sale. Some developers provide versions that include the source code.
*   [DNN Forge](http://www.DNNSoftware.com/Forge): Open source and free extensions.

You can also create your custom [modules](create-module) and [themes](create-theme).

To use an extension:

*   [Add the extension package to the DNN installation.](install-extension) Requires host permissions.
*   [Set the installed extension as Premium and enable it for the websites that are authorized to use it.](manage-premium-module) Requires host permissions.
*   Apply the extension to the site. Requires administrator or host permissions. If the extension is a module, you can also [set Deploy Module permissions to a role](allow-module-use), in order for members of that role to be able to add a module to a page.
