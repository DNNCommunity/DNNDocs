# About Workflows

A workflow is the process that content goes through in its lifetime, specifically during its creation. The workflow provides a structure for different roles to provide feedback regarding the content at various times in the process.

A state in a workflow represents the stages of the content-creation or content-editing process.

Example: The following can be states in the creation of a text asset:

|**Order**|**State**|**Reviewers**|
|---|---|---|
|1|Draft (default)| |
|2|Content/Technical review|Subject Matter Experts|
|3|Incorporation of feedback|Content Editors|
|4|Editing|Content Manager|
|5|Incorporation of edits|Content Editors|
|6|Published (default)|
