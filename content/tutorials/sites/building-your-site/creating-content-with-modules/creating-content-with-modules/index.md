# Creating Content with Modules

Modules are a type of extension that provides you with additional functionality on your page. The container associated with a module determines how it is displayed.

## Using Modules

You can add a module to a page:

*   As an independent instance. The new module instance is not affected by configuration changes made to other instances of the same module type.
*   As a reference to an existing module instance. If the module instance is reconfigured, even from another page, those changes will also be reflected on your page.

Each module on a page has its own action menu that allows you to configure the module and its behavior. Action menus are displayed when the page is in Edit mode.

*   Edit menu (pencil icon)
*   Manage menu (gear icon)
*   Move menu (four-arrow icon)
*   Custom menus specific to the module

Depending on module settings, site users could print, tag, and subscribe to the module's content.

DNN includes these modules which enable you to create content directly in DNN:

*   The HTML module allows you to enter static HTML text into your page.
*   The Module Creator enables a developer to create simple modules with custom functionality. (Requires administrator permissions on a local installation.)

You can also crowdsource your content by adding a Social module (e.g., Blogs, Journal, or Wiki) to a page in your site.
