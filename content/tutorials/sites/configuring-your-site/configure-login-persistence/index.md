# Configure Login Persistence

## Prerequisites

- **An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.
- **Backup your web.config file.** Any type of error in `web.config` can instantly make .Net application stop working. If anything goes wrong, make sure you know how to restore your `web.config` easily.

## Need to Know

- These settings have existed in DNN since at least version 3.x
- By default DNN
  - shows the "Remember Login" checkbox
  - persists logins for 60 mins (of inactivity)
  - does **not** extend your login persistence if "Remember Login" is checked
- These settings affect all Portals for this DNN instance
- Values for `timeout` and `PersistentCookieTimeout` are in minutes so 8 days is<br>`8 days x 24 hours x 60 mins = 10080`

## Steps

1.  Edit `web.config` in the website root (usually done via text editor or by accessing web.config in DNN's Settings / Config Manager [Access web.config](xref:access-web-config)).

2.  Update (or add) the following items to whatever values you require. All values are in minutes (i.e. 14 days is `14 x 24 hours x 60 minutes = 20160 minutes`).

    > [!Note] The following sets a) a default 2 hour session expiration and allows for b) a Remember Me option of 2 weeks via your cookie.

    a. Under **<`system.web`>**, then in **<`authentication` â€¦ />** Look for the `forms` tag and update the `timeout` attribute. Update the value of `timeout` with the desired value in minutes. After your change, the `forms` tag might look like this:

    ```
      <forms name=".DOTNETNUKE" protection="All" timeout="120" cookieless="UseCookies" />
    ```

    b. In **<`appSettings`>**, update (or add) the key for extended login persistence. After setting it for 2 weeks, your entry might look like this:

    ```
      <add key="PersistentCookieTimeout" value="20160" />
    ```

## In English

Stay logged in to the site

- by default (with Remember un-checked) for 2 hours
- with Remember checked for 14 days

Why 2 hours? Why 14 days? These are just examples. When we work on a DNN site for a client, during construction we like to have the Remember Login checkbox option turned on and visible, set the default to 2 hours and the persistent duration to 4 days (so a PersistentCookieTimeout of 5760). This way with the Remember option checked, your login will even survive a weekend.

The durations you choose should balance the users and usage against the real or perceived security concerns. But that is a much bigger topic for someone else's deep thinking blog article.
