# Site Aliases  
In DNN, it's possible for you to specify more than one domain name for your website to respond to.  For example, `domain1.com` and `domain2.com` could potentially be the same website. The site alias feature allows you to easily do this by simply adding the new/alternate domain name or URL.  These additional domain names might function in a redirect or canonical fashion.  It's up to you.  

There are many other ways to leverage the site alias feature such as migrating websites during rebranding, development, staging, and testing.  For instance, you may have a production website at `example.com`. Using this feature you could restore the production website in a staging environment and change the primary site alias to be `dev.example.com`.   

> [!NOTE]  
> This feature is sometimes referred to as _portal alias_ or _HTTP alias_ as well.
