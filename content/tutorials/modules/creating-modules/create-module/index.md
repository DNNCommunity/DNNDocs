# Creating a Module

You can produce a module in different ways:

*   Create an entire module from scratch. For very simple modules, you can use the DNN Module Creator.
*   Start with module development templates, such as:
    *   [DNN 8 Templates](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/DNN.Templates/releases/)
    *   [Chris Hammond's DotNetNuke Module and Theme Development Templates](https://github.com/ChrisHammond/DNNTemplates/) ([Installation instructions](https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2616/using-the-new-module-development-templates-for-dot/))
*   Customize a pre-existing module.

    Thousands of third-party modules and themes are available from the [DNN Store](https://store.dnnsoftware.com). There are extensions for sale, including versions that include the source code, as well as some free extension.


You can also use different programming frameworks (Web Forms, MVC, SPA) and languages (C#, VB) to create your module.
