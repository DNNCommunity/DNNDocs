    |Field|Description|
    |---|---|
    |<strong>Authorized</strong>|If enabled (<strong>On</strong>), the user is immediately subscribed to the <strong>Registered User</strong> role and to other roles that have <strong>Auto Assignment</strong> enabled. If disabled (<strong>Off</strong>), the user account is created but not authorized; an administrator must authorize the user account before the user can access areas of the website that are restricted to <strong>Registered User</strong> members.|
    |<strong>Random Password</strong>| If enabled (<strong>On</strong>), generates a random password. Otherwise, you must provide a password.|
    |<strong>Password</strong>|If the site is configured with password rules (i.e., minimum length), the initial password you assign must obey those password rules.|
    |<strong>Send an Email to New User</strong>|If checked, the user is notified by email that the account is created. Can be checked at a later time to send the email belatedly.|
