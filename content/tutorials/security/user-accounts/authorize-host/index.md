# Authorize a Host Account

A user account must be authorized for the account to be active. If you choose to delay the authorization, you can edit the account at a later time to authorize the account.

## Prerequisites

**An administrator account for the site.** Administrators have full permissions to the specific site.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Manage \> Users.

    ➋
    
2.  Search for the super user account.
    
    1.  From the Show dropdown, choose Superusers to filter the displayed accounts.
    2.  Browse the list for the user account.
