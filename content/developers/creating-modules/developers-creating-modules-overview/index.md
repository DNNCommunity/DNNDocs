# Creating a Module

You can produce a module in different ways:

*   Create an entire module from scratch. For very simple modules, you can use the DNN Module Creator.
*   Start with module development templates, such as:
    *   [DNN 8 Templates](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/DNN.Templates/releases/)
    *   [Chris Hammond's DotNetNuke Module and Theme Development Templates](https://github.com/ChrisHammond/DNNTemplates/) ([Installation instructions](https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2616/using-the-new-module-development-templates-for-dot/))
*   Customize a pre-existing module.

    Thousands of third-party modules and themes are available from these sources:

    *   [DNN Store](https://store.dnnsoftware.com): Extensions for sale. Some developers provide versions that include the source code.
    *   [DNN Community Github](https://www.github.com/DnnCommunity): Community maintained extensions including most of the formerly included core modules.
    *   [DNN Connect Community extensions page](https://www.dnn-connect.org/community/community-extensions): A collection of community maintained modules maitained by Dnn Connect.


You can also use different programming frameworks (Web Forms, MVC, SPA) and languages (C#, VB) to create your module.
