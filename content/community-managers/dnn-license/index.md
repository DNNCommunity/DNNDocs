3.1.2 For Perpetual License(s), the right to receive Support Services as long as LICENSEE remains a compliant subscriber of Support Services and a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable right to use the Software for the number of Licensed Instances in the Environment specified in an executed Order Form. The right to receive warranties and indemnification obligations will continue so long as LICENSEE remains a compliant subscriber of Support Services.

3.2 Third-Party Software. The Third-Party Software is subject to various other terms and conditions imposed by the licensors of the Third-Party Software. Such terms are set forth in the license folders distributed as a part of the Software. LICENSEE’s use of the Third-Party Software is subject to and governed by these respective licenses and terms except that this Section 3.2 and Sections 6.0 and 8.2 of this Agreement also govern LICENSEE’s use of the Third- Party Software. LICENSEE agrees to comply with such terms and conditions with respect to the applicable Third-Party Software.

3.3 Restrictions

3.3.1 General. LICENSEE shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, directly or indirectly: (i) sublicense, resell, rent, lease, distribute, market, commercialize or otherwise transfer rights or usage to: (a) the Software, (b) any modified version or derivative work of the Software created by or for the LICENSEE including any Forked version of the Software , for any purpose including timesharing or service bureau purposes; (ii) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or proprietary notice in the Software; (iii) transfer, use or export the Software in violation of any laws or regulations of any government or governmental agency; (iv) reverse engineer, decompile or modify any encrypted or encoded portion of the Software without prior written authorization from DNNCORP; or (v) use or run on any of LICENSEE’s hardware, or have deployed for use, any copy or version of the DNN Platform; or (vi) deploy the Software in contravention of the Instance Restriction.

3.3.2 Forking Prohibition. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, LICENSEE will not fork any version of, or offer or promote any forked version of, any software product released by DNNCORP, including without limitation the Community Edition of the Software. “Forking” means to bifurcate the source code for a DNNCORP product into a separately maintained source code repository so that development performed on the original code requires manual work to be transferred to the forked software or so that the forked software starts to have features not present in the original software.

3.3.3 Non-Production Environment Restriction. Non-Production Instances cannot be used in a Production Environment.

3.3.4 Development Environment Restriction. Development Instances cannot be used in a Production Environment or Non-Production Environment. LICENSEE needs to have a current Subscription License or be a compliant subscriber of Support Services with a Perpetual License in order to qualify for a Development Instance.

3.4 Assistance. LICENSEE will provide DNNCORP access to the Licensed Instances and other of LICENSEE’s information, systems, and software as reasonably requested by DNNCORP to enable DNNCORP to provide the Support Services. LICENSEE understands and agrees that the completeness and accuracy of and extent of access provided to DNNCORP may affect DNNCORP’s ability to provide Support Services. LICENSEE will obtain any third party consents as necessary to grant DNNCORP such access that is subject to proprietary rights of, or controlled by, any third party. LICENSEE may, for legitimate security concerns, deny DNNCORP certain access to certain LICENSEE information and the Licensed Instances, provided, however, that DNNCORP shall be relieved from performing Support Services which reasonably require such access.

3.5 Proprietary Rights. DNNCORP and its licensors own all right, title, and interest to the Software provided to LICENSEE, including all portions, copies, derivatives or modifications thereof.

3.6 Marks. No right or license, express or implied, is granted hereunder for the use of any of DNNCORP’s or DNNCORP affiliate’s trade names, service marks or trademarks. Notwithstanding the above, DNNCORP may use LICENSEE’s name and logo, consistent with LICENSEE’s trademark policies, on customer lists so long as such use in no way promotes either endorsement or approval of DNNCORP or any DNNCORP products or services.

3.7 Publicity. Neither party will, without the other party’s prior written consent, make any news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation of this Agreement, its value, or its terms and conditions herein. LICENSEE agrees to make representatives available, subject to their availability and only on an occasional basis, to serve as a non-public reference to prospective DNNCORP customers to discuss LICENSEE’s experience working with DNNCORP and to work with DNNCORP in developing and publishing case studies and press releases that describe LICENSEE’s use of the Software.

## 4.0 Reporting

4.1 Non-Circumvention. LICENSEE will not in any way modify or prevent the operation of any methods used within the Software to verify that its usage is licensed. Such methods may use and transmit information about the Licensed Instances to DNNCORP. Any information transmitted pursuant to this Section will not be provided to any third-parties except for the purpose of providing Services.

The Notice will include the number of additional Licensed Instances and the date(s) on which such additional Licensed Instances were put into use. DNNCORP will invoice LICENSEE for the additional Licensed Instances and LICENSEE will pay the additional Fees. DNNCORP may audit LICENSEE’s use of the Software, including but not limited to the number of Licensed Instances in use, to ensure that LICENSEE has made all the payments required under this Agreement. DNNCORP shall give LICENSEE reasonable prior notice of any such audit and conduct such audit during regular business hours. DNNCORP shall conduct the audit at its own expense unless LICENSEE is found to have materially underpaid amounts due under this Agreement (as reasonably determined by DNNCORP), in which case LICENSEE shall pay the cost of the audit. In any event, LICENSEE shall pay the amount of any underpayment within thirty (30) days after the completion of the audit.

Thereafter, the term for Services will renew for successive terms as defined in the Order Form and for the scope of use currently licensed unless a different term and scope is agreed to by the parties at the time of renewal, or unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its intention not to renew at least thirty (30) days before commencement of the next term. . Unless LICENSEE has been granted a right to use the Software pursuant to Section 3.1.2, then LICENSEE’s right to continued use of the Software in any Environment also terminates upon termination of this Agreement.

5.2 Termination. If LICENSEE or DNNCORP materially breaches the terms of this Agreement, and such breach is not cured or remedied within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach is given to the breaching party, then the other party, by giving written notice of termination to the breaching party, may terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that no cure period will be required for a breach of Section 7.0 hereof.

1\. Definitions.

“Error” means either (a) a failure of the Software to perform according to its specifications, resulting in the inability to use, or restriction in the use of, the Software, and/or (b) a problem requiring new procedures, clarifications, additional information and/or requests for product enhancements.

“Major Releases” means generally commercially released major new releases, modifications or enhancements to the Software, as designated by a change in the number to the left of the first decimal in the version number.

“Maintenance Releases” means generally commercially released code corrections, patches, updates and minor version releases of the Software, as designated by a change in any number to the right of the first decimal in the version number.

“Supported Version(s)” means the current release of Software and the immediately preceding version of the Software for a period of twelve (12) months after it is first superseded.

“Update” means either a software modification or addition that, when made or added to the Software, corrects the Error, or a procedure or routine that, when observed in the regular operation of the Software, eliminates the practical adverse effect of the Error on LICENSEE.

“Upgrade” means a revision of the Software released by DNNCORP to its end user customers generally, during the Support Services term, to add new and different functions or to increase the capacity of the Software. Upgrade does not include the release of a new product or added features for which there may be a separate Fee.

2\. Product Support.

Support Services includes all Major Releases and Maintenance Releases for Supported Versions. The response time for the support depends on the service level purchased by the LICENSEE.

5\. Maintenance Releases and Upgrades. During the term of this Agreement, DNNCORP shall make Maintenance Releases and Upgrades available to LICENSEE if, as and when DNNCORP makes any such Maintenance Releases or Upgrades generally available to its customers. If a question arises as to whether a product offering is an Upgrade or a new product or feature for which an incremental Fee is applicable, DNNCORP’s opinion will prevail, provided that if DNNCORP deems the product offering to be a new product or feature it will adopt this determination for all its end user customers generally and not for LICENSEE alone.

Any Support Services provided by DNNCORP hereunder shall be rendered on the non-modified portions of the Software only and LICENSEE acknowledges and agrees that any modification of the Software as a result of access to the Source Code Version may render it impossible for DNNCORP to provide full Support Services.

8\. Technical Support Contacts. DNNCORP will provide email support for one (1) designated contact who will develop, maintain or support LICENSEE’s applications that use the Software (“Technical Support Contact”). LICENSEE may modify its designated Technical Support Contact at any time during which LICENSEE is authorized to receive Support Services. The Technical Support Contact will be the only interface to the DNNCORP Customer Support Center. In an emergency and on an exception basis, a DNNCORP Customer Support Engineer will begin working on an Error for an employee of LICENSEE who is not the Technical Support Contact subject to later verification and involvement of the named Technical Support Contact.

9\. Customer Success Network. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, LICENSEE will be entitled to access Customer Success Network via Web interface. All electronic Services will be provided to the LICENSEE through Customer Success Network. All support incidents must be reported through Customer Success Network.

Communications between support staff and customers is handled primarily through Customer Success Network. On occasion, by mutual consent, telephone, VOIP or instant messaging communications may be used to expedite resolution of a problem. The parties will follow up such communications via logging into Customer Success Network. For tracking and recording purposes, each party is responsible for funding the cost of any such communication at their own locations.

While problems may be recorded at any time via the Customer Success Network, response times will be in line with the Service Levels stated for each service type (e.g., for tickets submitted overnight U.S. time, the clock will not start ticking until the next working day in the U.S.).

10\. Exclusions from Support Services. DNNCORP is not obligated to provide Support Services in the following situations: (a) the Software has been changed, modified or damaged (except if under the direct supervision of DNNCORP); (b) the Error is caused by LICENSEE’s negligence, hardware malfunction or other causes beyond the reasonable control of DNNCORP; (c) the Error is caused by third party software not licensed through DNNCORP; (d) LICENSEE has not installed and implemented Maintenance Release(s) so that the Software is not a Supported Version; or (e) LICENSEE has not paid the Fees for the Subscription License(s) when due.

11\. Termination of Support Services.
