    |**Field**|**Description**|
    |---|---|
    |**Experience Points**|The number of experience points that a user earns after performing this action. Must be a positive number.|
    |**Reputation Points**|The number of reputation points that a user earns after performing this action. Can be a positive or negative number.|
    |**Maximum Times**|The number of times within **Timeframe** that a user can earn points for this action.|
    |**Timeframe**|The most recent time interval within which **Maximum Times** is enforced.|
    

## Example

Example: If **Maximum Times** is 2 and **Timeframe** is **Daily**, then the user can earn points for the first two times that the action is performed within the past 24 hours. On the third and subsequent times that the user performs the same action within the past 24 hours, points are not awarded.
