|**Engagement**|**Influence**|
|---|---|
|Measures how involved the member is with the rest of the community.|Measures the positive or negative effect of the member on the community.|
|Engagement is internally computed and cannot be configured.|Influence is based on points (weight multiplied by value) earned by a registered user based on activities that affect their reputation in the community.|

## Influence Configuration

The Influence score is affected by a set of goals that the community manager configures.
