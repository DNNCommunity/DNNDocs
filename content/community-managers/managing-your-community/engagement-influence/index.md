# Community Engagement and Influence

Engagement and Influence provide insight into the relationships among your community members.

Engagement

Influence

Measures how involved the member is with the rest of the community.

Measures the positive or negative effect of the member on the community.

Engagement is internally computed and cannot be configured.

Influence is based on points (weight multiplied by value) earned by a registered user based on activities that affect their reputation in the community.

## Influence Configuration

The Influence score is affected by a set of goals that the community manager configures.
