# About DNN Microservices APIs

## About the DNN Microservices APIs

The DNN Microservices APIs provide access to actual content and related objects served by the DNN microservices. Unlike the module-creation APIs, these APIs use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to communicate with the microservices.

For more information, see [Creating Apps That Use Microservices](xref:creating-apps-that-use-microservices).
